# Limitations & boundaries (measured)

[日本語版](limitations.ja.md)

An honest, measured map of what algebraic-filter (AF) can do, what is an
extension, and what is structurally out of scope. All rows are backed by a
probe you can reproduce (see [Reproduce](#reproduce)).

> One-line boundary: **AF verifies *structure* (algebraic laws / data movement /
> lint), not *intent* (whether the code matches the spec).** It can tell that
> `average` should be commutative; it cannot tell whether `average` should add 1.

## ① What it does (measured true positives)

| Capability | Layer | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Lint defects: PERF / SIM / FURB / ANN / F / RUF013 | 1 (ruff) | ~16 ms via the ruff binary |
| Data movement: intermediate-list-chain / dict-keys-list / explicit-copy / string-concat-in-loop | 3 (AST) | + tracemalloc runtime |
| Algebraic-law violations (Monoid / Functor / Monad / …) | 2 (hypothesis) | **only on keyword-named functions** — see ③ |
| Structured feedback → Claude self-correction | 4 | measured pass@1 raw 20→100%, curated 91.7→100% (small-n, own corpus) |

On AF's own 46-sample corpus: full-stack detection **28/46 (61%)**.

## ② Extensible (reachable with work)

| Gap | Effort |
|---|---|
| Inferrer keyword coverage (`add` / `plus` / `total` / `mean` currently skipped) | small — add keywords |
| More algebraic laws (beyond the current 13) | small–medium |
| Type-checking (pyright) | **already available** via the hybrid / Docker mode |
| Other languages (TypeScript / Rust) | large — different ecosystems; Rust's trait system fits the algebra axis best |

## ③ Structurally out of scope (measured misses)

Probes fed deliberately-defective code and recorded the hook's exit code
(`AF_HOOK_PHASE2_PBT=1`). `exit 0` = miss (clean pass):

| Defect probe | Result |
|---|---|
| off-by-one (`xs[len(xs)]`) | exit 0 — **miss** |
| type error (`-> str` returns int), AF alone | exit 0 — **miss** (pyright covers it in hybrid) |
| security (`eval(user_input)`) | exit 0 — **miss** |
| concurrency / shared mutable aliasing | exit 0 — **miss** |
| **monoid violation on a non-keyword-named function** (`thingy` that subtracts) | exit 0 — **miss** |
| semantic bug on a keyword-named function (`my_average` that adds 1) | exit 2 — caught (because `average` → commutativity, and +1 broke it) |

The last two rows are the key nuance: AF catches a semantic bug **only when it
manifests as an algebraic-law violation on a function whose name the inferrer
recognizes**. Rename the function and the same bug passes clean.

### Phase 2 inferrer is a name heuristic, not semantic understanding

Measured keyword coverage over 32 common function names: **12/32 = 38%** trigger
law inference.

- Recognized (✓): `sum` `merge` `concat` `combine` `union` `fold` `reduce`
  `aggregate` `fmap` `map` `transform` `average`
- Skipped (·): `total` `add` `plus` `join` `accumulate` `apply` `compose`
  `mean` `max` `min` `count` `sort` `filter` `dedup` `normalize` `compute`
  `process` `handle` `calc` `thingy` …

Consequence — Phase 2 has **two-sided error**:
- **false negatives**: a real law violation on a non-recognized name (e.g.
  `add` that isn't associative) is missed.
- **false positives**: a function correctly named `merge` but intentionally
  *not* commutative (e.g. left-biased merge) would be flagged.

## The honest takeaway

AF's value is **automatic structural guardrails**; spec/intent correctness
remains the job of tests, human review, and (for types) pyright. "Out of scope"
here is a deliberate niche boundary, not a defect: AF guards the structure
axis well within its niche, and routes everything else to the appropriate tool.

## Reproduce

```bash
# false-negative probes (buggy code outside AF's defect classes)
# inferrer keyword coverage
# both were run inline 2026-05-21; the exact probe code is in this commit message
python -m pytest samples/violations/tests/   # the positive-side coverage (106 passed / 4 skipped)
python scripts/compare_competitor.py          # AF vs competitor detection (28/46 vs 7/46)
```
